Historitor is a transactional log implementation, inspired by Redis and Kafka.

We urge you to read the [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MadsRC/historitor) to get a better understanding
of the project.

## Go Support

Historitor follows the same support policy as the Go project, meaning that the two most recent major Go versions are
supported.

Read more about the Go support policy [here](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).

## Security

The security policy for this project can be found [here](./SECURITY.md).

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Each release of Historitor contains a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the form of a JSON file. The SBOM is
generated as part of the release process and is available in the release artifacts. The release artifacts for the latest
release can be found [here](https://github.com/MadsRC/historitor/releases/latest).
